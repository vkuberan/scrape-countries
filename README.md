# Scrape Countries details using PythonÂ Requests
For a fun project, I had to get details like the President, Capital city, population, GDP, etc., of every individual 'Member states of the United Nations' It is time-consuming to get these data manually. So I thought it was better to write a simple program using Python to get these data.
